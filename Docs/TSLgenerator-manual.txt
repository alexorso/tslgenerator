This document describes our interpretation of the TSL
language presented in Ostrand and Balcers 1988 CACM paper.
Our syntax is almost exactly like that presented in the
paper; however, our interpretation of the semantics of that
syntax required several choices due to lack of details
in the paper.


Comments
--------

The '#' character marks a comment until the next newline.

e.g.    # Comment: [everything] is. ignored, even # chars
        # The property list below will be ignored
        a choice.           # [property Skin]


Categories
----------

A string ending with the ':' (colon) character is
interpreted as a category.

The "Parameters:" and "Environments:" category divisions
will be ignored (because they really only serve to help
the tester create the specs -- categories within either
division are then treated the same during test frame
generation), as will any category that isn't followed
by any choices.

e.g.    Parameters:            # this one will be ignored
            Pattern size:      # this one won't
                empty.         [property Empty]


Choices
-------

A string ending with the '.' (period) character is
interpreted as a choice.
    
e.g.    this is another choice.     [single]
                              ^

Constraints
-----------

The '[' character marks a constraint until the next ']'
character.  Constraints are applied to the choice they
follow.  They can't be applied to categories.

Individual constraints can't span multiple lines, but the
set of constraints for a choice can.

e.g.    simple choice.  [if thisIsAReallyLongProperty]
                            [single]
                        [else]
                            [property short]

Constraints are case sensitive, so [ELSE], [Else], or any
other variations won't work.

The three types of constraints are property lists,
error/single markings, and selector expressions.


Property Lists
--------------

[property <name1>, <name2>, ... <namek>]

Sets the properties <name1>, <name2>, ... <namek> to
true.  They can later be referenced in an selector
expression.  Property names are case sensitive.

Each choice can have several property lists, but not more
than 10 properties total.

e.g.    # this choice uses the max number of properties
        a choice.     [if ABC] [property 1, 2, 3, 4]
                      [else] [property 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


Error & Single Markings
-----------------------

[error]
[single]

Both markings signal that only one test frame should be
generated; the meaning you give each of them is the only
difference.  The one test frame will be appropriately
marked as an error or single.


Selector Expressions
--------------------

[if <expression>] <error/single> <property list>
[else] <error/single> <property list>

The [else] is optional, and so are the <error/single> and
<property list> for both [if] and [else].  

If <expression> evaluates to true then the following
three steps are applied to the statements after the [if].
Otherwise, the steps are applied to the statements after
the [else] (if there is one).

 1) If there's an error or single marking only one frame
    is generated for this choice.  The property list is
    ignored and this choice isn't combined with any other
    choices, but its dependencies are shown (if any).
    
 2) Otherwise this choice is selected to be combined with
    other choices.
    
 3) If there's a property list its properties are set to
    true.

A choice can have only one selector expression (you can't
nest them like [if] ... [else] [if] ... ).


How Choices Are Selected
------------------------

If a choice has no error/single markings or selector
expression then it is always selected (it might have a
property list).

e.g.    #this choice is always selected
        a good choice is this.      [property Goodness]

When there is an error/single marking before a selector
expression the expression is ignored.  This allows you to
experiment with marking choices as strictly error/single
without having to comment out previous constraints.

e.g.    # only one frame is ever generated for this choice
        [single] [if Random] [property RandQuoted]

When there is a selector expression any property lists
should follow it.  If there is a property list before a
selector expression the property list is ignored.

e.g.    # Long will never be set to true
        [property Long] [if Unquoted] [property Zero]


Examples:

1.  [if NonEmpty]
    Reads:  if NonEmpty is true combine this choice with
                others.

2.  [if Hmmmmm] [single]
    Reads:  if Hmmmmm is true make a single frame with
                this choice.

3.  [if Radical] [property Cool] [else] [error]
    Reads:  if Radical is true set Cool to true and
                combine this choice with others,
            else make an error frame with this choice.

4.  [if NoWay] [single] [else]
    Reads:  if NoWay is true make a single frame with
                this choice,
            else combine this choice with others.

5.  [error]
    Reads:  make an error frame with this choice.

6.  [property IC] [single]
    Reads:  make a single frame with this choice.
            (the property list is ignored)

7.  [single] [if Random] [property RandQuoted]
    Reads:  make a single frame with this choice.
            (the selector expression is ignored)

8.  [property Oh, Yeah]
    Reads:  set Oh and Yeah to true and combine this
                choice with others.

9.  [property Long] [if Unquoted] [error]
                    [else] [property Zero]
    Reads:  if Unquoted is true make an error frame with
                this choice,
            else set Zero to true and combine this choice
                with others.
            (the first property list is ignored)
    
    
Expressions
-----------

The logical operators 'and', 'or', and '!' (not) can be
used in a selector expression.  The normal order of
evaluation is used (not > and > or), and the terms can be
grouped using parentheses to change the order of
evaluation.

Examples:

    [if A]
    [if !B]
    [if A or B]
    [if A and B]
    [if !(A and B)]
    [if A and B or C]
    [if A and (B or C) and D]
    [if A or !B and !C]
    [if !(!A or B) and C or D]

The entire expression doesn't need to be enclosed in
parentheses.  The following example is what NOT to do.

    [if (A and B or C)]
